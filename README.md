# vim-hitme
My extremely minimal, yet useful, vim configuration.
Plugin management is handled by junegunn/vim-plug.

### Notes for Windows Users:
You might want to add these lines to the bottom of your _vimrc file:
```vim
set belloff=all
set nobackup
set nowritebackup
```
Also, change `set clipboard=unnamedplus` to `set clipboard=unnamed`.

### Notes for Mac Users:
Change `set clipboard=unnamedplus` to `set clipboard=unnamed`.
